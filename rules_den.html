<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>WolfTV abides by a strict no-hate policy as well as the <a href="https://fgcoc.com/">Fighting Game Code of Conduct</a>. Please refer to the #rules channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/xFejWpb">WolfTV Discord</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="discord">Discord</h2>
<p>All participants to a Battle for the Den tournament must be present in the <a href="https://discord.gg/xFejWpb">WolfTV Discord</a> and assign themselves the Battle for the Den role. <strong>Failure to join the WolfTV Discord will result in an automatic diqualification.</strong></p>
<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>In order to facilitate communication between players, tournament admins and mods, we request that all people who take part in the Battle for the Den environment to favor English over other languages. (Although don't worry if your English is on the poor side, as long as we can all understand you)</p>
<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
<p>Registration for a specific Battle for the Den event is done using the corresponding event link. The exact procedure may differ depending on the website used, so make sure to follow the instructions which come up on screen.</p>
<p>Registration deadlines may differ from event to event.</p>
<p>Participants under the age of 18 must submit a consent letter from their parent or legal guardian to the TOs (@The TO Pack in the Discord) and cannot take part in tournaments for games rated PEGI 18. Children under 12 are not allowed to take part in tournaments where cash prizes are involved.</p>
<p>An active subscription to the game platform's online service (e.g. PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Switch Online, Xbox Game Pass Core, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate) may be required to take part in a given tournament.</p>
<h2 id="check-in">Check-in</h2>
<p>You will be required to check-in before the event starts. The check-in period begins 30 minutes before the event starts and ends on the planned start time and will be done through the specific event page (The one where you registered) <strong>No admin-side check-in will be done before, during or after the check-in period</strong> outside of very specific cases, so don't forget to check-in!</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-tournament">Starting the tournament</h2>
<p>Once you are checked-in, you will have to wait for the tournament to start. A tournament admin will ping the specific game role when the tournament is ready to start. As such, <strong>any games played before the admin greenlight will not count towards tournament results</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-into-a-game">Getting into a game</h2>
<p>Once the tournament starts, the tournament admin will call out which rounds of the tournament can be played. <strong>Please wait until your current tournament round has been called out before playing the associated match</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to communicate with your opponent, you can use any of the numbered arena channels. We heavily encourage the use of said channels in order to exchange Online IDs and player interaction over other systems, including the chatboxes which may be provided on the event page.</p>
<p>Sometimes, tournament admins may decide a match should be streamed live. In this case, players involved in the match will be informed at the same time the tournament round gets called out, and communication will happen using the #stream-arena channel. Please note <strong>the #stream-arena channel cannot be used for non-streamed matches</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not show up to your match in the 10 minutes after it was marked as both playable and available, you will be DQed.</strong> If you are playing in another online bracket at the same time, please warn The TO Pack before the tournament starts and eventually indicate in your Discord nickname that you are plaing in said other bracket.</p>
<h2 id="sportsmanship-and-lag">Sportsmanship and lag</h2>
<p>We want to remind everyone to keep civil in the discussions and follow some basic principles of sportsmanship. In case of disagreement, please warn a mod or tournament admin, we will then take appropriate action depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Given the context of online tournaments, technical issues such as extreme lag may happen. In case this happens, please ask a mod or tournament admin for help so we can try and debug the situation and make the appropriate decision once we have all the data available.</p>
<p>Please note that by default, players playing on Wi-Fi will be disqualified when involved in lag situations.</p>
<h2 id="region-locked-tournament">Region-locked tournament</h2>
<p>Some tournaments may be locked to certain parts of the world. If so, please only register for tournaments specific to your region. <strong>Entering an out-of-region tournament may result in you getting banned from both the event you registered for and a later, equivalent tournament catered towards your region</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>Some additional requirements may need to be met in order to claim their prize, such as having an account on a given website. <strong>Failure to meet those requirements 10 days after the event has ended will result in you no longer being eligible to get any prizes.</strong> In which case the cash prize will be redistributed between all players who met the requirements. Should all 3 winners of the prize pot not meet the requirements, the pot will be redistributed either as part of the pot for a future event or as sponsorship money for partnered events.</p>
<h2 id="game-specific-rules">Game-specific rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>In all of the following rulesets, the highest seeded player is referred to as Player 1 and his opponent as Player 2 by default. The players may however agree to switch sides. If the players disagree to switching sides, they may ask a TO to <a href="https://justflipacoin.com/">flip a coin</a> to decide who is Player 1 and who is Player 2.</li>
<li><strong>Ties:</strong> In case the current game ends in a tie, both players get a point. If the tie is decisive (e.g. a tie after a 2-2 situation in a FT3 match) then the game is replayed until the tie is broken.</li>

<li>
<p>All input devices are allowed as long as they follow the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each button or input must only be mapped once on the device</li>
<li>Macro and turbo inputs are banned<ul>
<li>A macro input is defined as a single button mapped to pressing multiple button inputs, either simultaneously on in a sequence<ul>
<li>Macros allowed on the software side by the game are excluded from this rule</li>
<li>Macros mapped whithin the emulator software are included in this rule</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A turbo input is defined as a single button being switched periodically between a pressed and unpressed state from holding said button</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The device is equipped with an SOCD cleaning method for D-Pad inputs. The SOCDâ€¯cleaning must occur as follows, unless specified otherwise in the gameâ€™s ruleset:<ul>
<li>Left + Right = Neutral (4+6 = 5)</li>
<li>Up + Down = Neutral (2+8 = 5) OR Up + Down = Up (2+8 = 8)</li>

<p>Players in the same online event are not allowed to share setups (A setup includes a screen, a console/PC, an input device and a copy of the game). If two players are found to be sharing a setup or elements of their setups after check-ins, leading to the tournament being slowed down, then both players will be disqualified</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using software hacks to tamper with the gameâ€™s programming or your inputs will result in a permanent ban from all future WolfTV events. Examples include (but are not limited to) using hacks to automatically react to Drive Impact or instantly block overheads in Street Fighter 6, or using hacks to play as NPC bosses in KOFXV (e.g. Re Verse, Otoma=Raga, Rugal-Boss, Goenitz-Boss)</p>
