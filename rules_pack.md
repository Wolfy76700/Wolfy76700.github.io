## Preface

WolfTV abides by a strict no-hate policy as well as the [Fighting Game Code of Conduct](https://fgcoc.com/). Please refer to the #rules channel in the [WolfTV Discord](https://discord.gg/xFejWpb) for more information.

## Discord
All participants to a From Pack to Pack - Open event must be present in the [WolfTV Discord](https://discord.gg/xFejWpb) and assign themselves From Pack to Pack - Open role. **As communication between the teams and the TOs is primarily handled by the captain, failure to join the WolfTV Discord for the captain will result in an automatic diqualification for the entire team.**

## Language
In order to facilitate communication between players, tournament admins and mods, we request that all people who take part in the From Pack to Pack environment to favor English over other languages. (Although don't worry if your English is on the poor side, as long as we can all understand you)

## Event course

### Open event

#### Registration

Registration for open events in the From Pack to Pack series is done using the corresponding event link. The exact procedure may differ depending on the website used, so make sure to follow the instructions which come up on screen.

Registration deadlines may differ from event to event.

Participants under the age of 18 must submit a consent letter from their parent or legal guardian to the TOs (@The TO Pack in the Discord) and cannot take part in tournaments for games rated PEGI 18. Children under 12 are not allowed to take part in tournaments where cash prizes are involved.

An active subscription to the game platform's online service (e.g. PlayStation Plus, Xbox Game Pass Core, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Nintendo Switch Online) may be required for each team member to take part in a given tournament.

By registering, all participants engage themselves to play all of their pools matches during the allocated time span, and to be available for the Semi-Finals and Finals’ time slot.

All players for all teams, including potential bench players, must be registered before the Pools Draw stream. **No additional player or team will be accepted after the pools draw.**

#### Format

When registering a team, you are invited however to register up to 5 players, however, only 3 players may take part in any given match. The format is as follows:

- In all of the current document, the highest seeded team is referred to as Team 1 and the opposing team as Team 2 by default. The team captains may however agree to switch sides. If the players disagree to switching sides, they may ask a TO to [flip a coin](https://justflipacoin.com/) to decide who is Team 1 and who is Team 2.
- When starting a match, Team Captains must announce which 3 players in their team will be taking part in the match, with Team 1 announcing their composition before Team 2. Once the team compositions are announced, they cannot be changed for the duration of the match, though the team order is not locked.
- Both teams send out their first player, with Team 1 announcing their player first. The first set is played.
    - The format and course for a set depends on the game being played, please refer to [Game-specific rules](#game-specific-rules) for more information
- Once a set is played to completion, the winning team gets a point, and the player who just lost on the losing team is considered "dead" and can no longer play.
    - The Captain for the losing team then picks and sends in one of their remaining players, while the winning team cannot swap players.
    - Set-based advantages are reset for every new set (e.g., the Winner of the previous set is not beholden to his character choice for Game 1 of the new set)
- The process gets repeated until all three of the players announced at the start are defeated. The Team Captain is then responsible for reporting the score on the bracket managing website.
- **Ties:** In case the current game ends in a tie, both players get a point. If the tie is decisive for the set (e.g. a tie after a 2-2 situation in a FT3 match) then the game is replayed until the tie is broken.

#### Pools

Pools will be finalized during a Pools Draw stream. Once pools are finalized, the TO will announce on both [FGC.Network](https://fgc.network/@WolfTV) and the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xFejWpb) that matches can now be played.

Team captains are responsible for making sure all of their pools matches are played during the 2-week period allocated to pools, and scheduling accordingly. Team Captains need to warn the TOs as soon as a match is scheduled, and scores need to be reported to the TOs as soon as a match is played.

In order to more easily schedule the matches, we recommend the use of tools like [HammerTime](https://hammertime.cyou/), which can generate a timestamp which can be pasted in Discord. This allows for everyone to see the timestamp in their local timezone.

For easier communication we request that each pool match has its own thread in #pack-match-chat where both teams and the TOs can communicate between each other. The thread title should ideally follow the following format:  
     `[Open {number} - Pool {letter}] {Team 1} VS {Team 2}` (e.g. `[Open 2 - Pool B] Fadee Gaming VS Les Presque PHX`)

Each team is heavily encouraged to stream their matches on their own. No pools stream will be organized by WolfTV.

Pools matches will be have individual event pages on Discord with the links to each match’s announced streams. For an easier organisation, as well as social media purposes, we request that matches happening on a given day are reported to the TOs at least before 10:00 CET/CEST¹ the day the match happens. This of course does not apply to matches happening the day of the Pools Draw.

¹ *Depending on whether Daylight savings are on. Corresponds to UTC+1/UTC+2 respectively.*

#### Final bracket

The final bracket will be a single-elimination event featuring the best teams from Pools. Semi-Finals and Finals will be played on stream on two different time slots, announced alongside the event by the TO.

During the stream, all communication between the TOs, streamers, captains and players will be done through the #pack-stream-arena channel

### Invitational event

#### Registration

Invitational events in the From Pack to Pack series are limited to entrants predetermined by the TO of said event.

#### Check-ins

Check-ins for invitational events are handled on a case by case basis. Please refer to the event’s TO ahead of time for more information.

#### Format

Invitational events ane designed to be able to be ran in a single day. The format for invitational events is defined on a case by case basis. Please refer to the event’s TO ahead of time for more information.

#### Starting the event

Once you are checked-in, you will have to wait for the event to start. A tournament admin will ping the specific game role when the tournament is ready to start. As such, **any games played before the admin greenlight will not count towards tournament results**.

#### Getting into a game
Once the tournament starts, the tournament admin will call out which rounds of the tournament can be played. **Please wait until your current tournament round has been called out before playing the associated match**.

In order to communicate with your opponent, you can use any of the numbered arena channels. We heavily encourage the use of said channels in order to exchange Online IDs and player interaction over other systems, including the chatboxes which may be provided on the event page.

Sometimes, tournament admins may decide a match should be streamed live. In this case, players involved in the match will be informed at the same time the tournament round gets called out, and communication will happen using the #stream-arena channel. Please note **the #stream-arena channel cannot be used for non-streamed matches**.

**If any team member does not show up to their match in the 10 minutes after it was marked as both playable and available, the entire team will be DQed.** If you are playing in another online bracket at the same time, please warn The TO Pack before the tournament starts and eventually indicate in your Discord nickname that you are plaing in said other bracket.

## Sportsmanship and lag
We want to remind everyone to keep civil in the discussions and follow some basic principles of sportsmanship. In case of disagreement, please warn a mod or tournament admin, we will then take appropriate action depending on the situation.

Given the context of online tournaments, technical issues such as extreme lag may happen. In case this happens, please ask a mod or tournament admin for help so we can try and debug the situation and make the appropriate decision once we have all the data available.

Please note that teams with players playing on Wi-Fi will be disqualified.

## Region-locked tournament
Some tournaments may be locked to certain parts of the world. If so, please only register for tournaments specific to your region. **Entering an out-of-region tournament may result in you getting banned from both the event you registered for and a later, equivalent tournament catered towards your region**

- 2nd: 1/3 of the cash prize (~33 %)

Should all 3 winners of the prize pot not meet the requirements, the pot will be redistributed either as part of the pot for a future event or as sponsorship money for partnered events.

## Addendum

- Players need to use an Ethernet cable to connect to their router. In case the device you're using does not have an Ethernet port (e.g. Laptop...), here is our recommended USB to Ethernet adapter: [United Kingdom](https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Adaptateur-Ethernet-Supporte-Supérieur/dp/B00MYTSN18/), [France](https://www.amazon.fr/UGREEN-Adaptateur-Ethernet-Supporte-Supérieur/dp/B00MYTSN18/), [Netherlands](https://www.amazon.nl/UGREEN-Adaptateur-Ethernet-Supporte-Supérieur/dp/B00MYTSN18/), [Germany](https://www.amazon.de/UGREEN-Adaptateur-Ethernet-Supporte-Supérieur/dp/B00MYTSN18/)

__**Please note that teams with players playing on Wi-Fi will be disqualified.**__

- All input devices are allowed as long as they follow the following specifications:
    - Each button or input must only be mapped once on the device
    - Macro and turbo inputs are banned
        - A macro input is defined as a single button mapped to pressing multiple button inputs, either simultaneously on in a sequence
            - Macros allowed on the software side by the game are excluded from this rule
            - Macros mapped whithin the emulator software are included in this rule
        - A turbo input is defined as a single button being switched periodically between a pressed and unpressed state from holding said button
    - The device is equipped with an SOCD cleaning method for D-Pad inputs. The SOCD cleaning must occur as follows, unless specified otherwise in the game’s ruleset:
        - Left + Right = Neutral (4+6 = 5)
        - Up + Down = Neutral (2+8 = 5)
    - Analog to Digital conversions are allowed for both the Left Stick and Right Stick inputs. Exact specifications may vary on a per game basis.

- Players in the same online event are not allowed to share setups if they’re in different teams (A setup includes a screen, a console/PC, an input device and a copy of the game). If two players from different teams are found to be sharing a setup or elements of their setups after check-ins, leading to the tournament being slowed down, then both players and their respective teams will be disqualified. Players in a same team are allowed to share a setup as long as both the TOs and their opponents are warned of who is playing at any given time.

- Using software hacks to tamper with the game’s programming or your inputs will result in a permanent ban from all future WolfTV events for the guilty player, and an event ban for the team. Examples include (but are not limited to) using hacks to automatically react to Drive Impact or instantly block overheads in Street Fighter 6, or using hacks to play as NPC bosses in KOFXV (e.g. Re Verse, Otoma=Raga, Rugal-Boss, Goenitz-Boss)
    - Cosmetic mods are allowed as long as they don’t interfere with the gameplay or the game’s online connectivity. Examples include (but are not limited to) most palette swap mods in Fightcade, the English voice mod in DNF Duel or most Potato mods
