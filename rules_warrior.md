## Preface

WolfTV abides by a strict no-hate policy as well as the [Fighting Game Code of Conduct](https://fgcoc.com/). Please refer to the #rules channel in the [WolfTV Discord](https://discord.gg/xFejWpb) for more information.

## Discord
All participants to a Wolf Warrior tournament must be present in the [WolfTV Discord](https://discord.gg/xFejWpb) and assign themselves the Wolf Warrior role. **Failure to join the WolfTV Discord will result in an automatic diqualification.**

## Language
In order to facilitate communication between players, tournament admins and mods, we request that all people who take part in the Wolf Warrior environment to favor English over other languages. (Although don't worry if your English is on the poor side, as long as we can all understand you)

## Registration
Registration for a specific Wolf Warrior event is done using the corresponding event link. The exact procedure may differ depending on the website used, so make sure to follow the instructions which come up on screen.

Registration deadlines may differ from event to event.

Participants under the age of 18 must submit a consent letter from their parent or legal guardian to the TOs (@The TO Pack in the Discord) and cannot take part in tournaments for games rated PEGI 18. Children under 12 are not allowed to take part in tournaments where cash prizes are involved.

An active subscription to the game platform's online service (e.g. PlayStation Plus, Xbox Game Pass Core, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate) may be required to take part in a given tournament.

## Check-in
You will be required to check-in before the event starts. The check-in period begins 30 minutes before the event starts and ends on the planned start time and will be done through the specific event page (The one where you registered) **No admin-side check-in will be done before, during or after the check-in period** outside of very specific cases, so don't forget to check-in!

## Starting the tournament
Once you are checked-in, you will have to wait for the tournament to start. A tournament admin will ping the specific game role when the tournament is ready to start. As such, **any games played before the admin greenlight will not count towards tournament results**.

## Getting into a game
Once the tournament starts, the tournament admin will call out which rounds of the tournament can be played. **Please wait until your current tournament round has been called out before playing the associated match**.

In order to communicate with your opponent, you can use the #singles-general channel. Please be aware though that said channel may get easily cluttered, so we recommend you create a thread there if you want to communicate with your opponent.

Sometimes, tournament admins may decide a match should be streamed live. In this case, players involved in the match will be informed at the same time the tournament round gets called out, and communication will happen using the #singles-stream-arena channel. Please note **the #singles-stream-arena channel cannot be used for non-streamed matches**.

**If you do not show up to your match in the 10 minutes after it was marked as both playable and available, you will be DQed.** If you are playing in another online bracket at the same time, please warn The TO Pack before the tournament starts and eventually indicate in your Discord nickname that you are plaing in said other bracket.

## Sportsmanship and lag
We want to remind everyone to keep civil in the discussions and follow some basic principles of sportsmanship. In case of disagreement, please warn a mod or tournament admin, we will then take appropriate action depending on the situation.

Given the context of online tournaments, technical issues such as extreme lag may happen. In case this happens, please ask a mod or tournament admin for help so we can try and debug the situation and make the appropriate decision once we have all the data available.

Please note that players playing on Wi-Fi will be disqualified.

## Region-locked tournament
The Wolf Warrior events are currently region-locked to Europe and Maghreb. **Entering from another region will result in you getting banned from the event.**

### Region guide

- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º **Europe:** Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland), Norway, Switzerland, Monaco, Andorra, Vatican City, San Marino, Montenegro, Liechtenstein, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Albania, Moldova, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia-West (Northwestern, Central, North Caucasian, Southern, Crimea, Volga), Israel, Palestine
- ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦ **Maghreb:** Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Western Sahara, Canary Islands, Madere Islands, Lybia, Mauritania

## Cash prizes
An event may reward good placing players with a cash prize in some instances. Should this happen, the total cash prize for the event will be communicated ahead of the tournament, and will be split between the Top 3 placements as follows:

- 1st: 1/2 of the cash prize (50 %)
- 2nd: 1/3 of the cash prize (~33 %)
- 3rd: 1/6 of the cash prize (~17 %)

Some additional requirements may need to be met in order to claim their prize, such as having an account on a given website. **Failure to meet those requirements 10 days after the event has ended will result in you no longer being eligible to get any prizes.** In which case the cash prize will be redistributed between all players who met the requirements. Should all 3 winners of the prize pot not meet the requirements, the pot will be redistributed either as part of the pot for a future event or as sponsorship money for partnered events.

## Game-specific rules

- In all of the following rulesets, the highest seeded player is referred to as Player 1 and his opponent as Player 2 by default. The players may however agree to switch sides. If the players disagree to switching sides, they may ask a TO to [flip a coin](https://justflipacoin.com/) to decide who is Player 1 and who is Player 2.
- **Ties:** In case the current game ends in a tie, both players get a point. If the tie is decisive (e.g. a tie after a 2-2 situation in a FT3 match) then the game is replayed until the tie is broken.

### Street Fighter 6

- The tournament is played in a **First to 2** format
- **Top 6** is played in a **First to 3** format
    - Top 6 includes Winners Semis, Winners Finals, Losers Quarters, Losers Semis, Losers Finals and Grand Finals
- All characters are allowed
- Classic and Modern control modes are allowed. Dynamic controls are banned.
- All platforms are allowed
- You can switch characters and control mode if you lost the previous game, however the winner cannot switch characters
- WolfTV and the Wolf Warrior series are not affiliated with or sponsored by Capcom

## Addendum

- Players need to use an Ethernet cable to connect to their router. In case the device you're using does not have an Ethernet port (e.g. Laptop...), here is our recommended USB to Ethernet adapter: [United Kingdom](https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Adaptateur-Ethernet-Supporte-SupÃ©rieur/dp/B00MYTSN18/), [France](https://www.amazon.fr/UGREEN-Adaptateur-Ethernet-Supporte-SupÃ©rieur/dp/B00MYTSN18/), [Netherlands](https://www.amazon.nl/UGREEN-Adaptateur-Ethernet-Supporte-SupÃ©rieur/dp/B00MYTSN18/), [Germany](https://www.amazon.de/UGREEN-Adaptateur-Ethernet-Supporte-SupÃ©rieur/dp/B00MYTSN18/)

__**Please note that players playing on Wi-Fi will be disqualified.**__

- All input devices are allowed as long as they follow the following specifications:
    - Each button or input must only be mapped once on the device
    - Macro and turbo inputs are banned
        - A macro input is defined as a single button mapped to pressing multiple button inputs, either simultaneously on in a sequence
            - Macros allowed on the software side by the game are excluded from this rule
            - Macros mapped whithin the emulator software are included in this rule
        - A turbo input is defined as a single button being switched periodically between a pressed and unpressed state from holding said button
    - The device is equipped with an SOCD cleaning method for D-Pad inputs. The SOCDâ€¯cleaning must occur as follows, unless specified otherwise in the gameâ€™s ruleset:
        - Left + Right = Neutral (4+6 = 5)
        - Up + Down = Neutral (2+8 = 5)
    - Analog to Digital conversions are allowed for both the Left Stick and Right Stick inputs. Exact specifications may vary on a per game basis.

- Players in the same online event are not allowed to share setups (A setup includes a screen, a console/PC, an input device and a copy of the game). If two players are found to be sharing a setup or elements of their setups after check-ins, leading to the tournament being slowed down, then both players will be disqualified

- Using software hacks to tamper with the gameâ€™s programming or your inputs will result in a permanent ban from all future WolfTV events. Examples include (but are not limited to) using hacks to automatically react to Drive Impact or instantly block overheads in Street Fighter 6, or using hacks to play as NPC bosses in KOFXV (e.g. Re Verse, Otoma=Raga, Rugal-Boss, Goenitz-Boss)
    - Cosmetic mods are allowed as long as they donâ€™t interfere with the gameplay or the gameâ€™s online connectivity. Examples include (but are not limited to) most palette swap mods in Fightcade, the English voice mod in DNF Duel or most Potato mods
