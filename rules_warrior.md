## Preface

WolfTV abides by a strict no-hate policy as well as the [Fighting Game Code of Conduct](https://fgcoc.com/). Please refer to the #rules channel in the [WolfTV Discord](https://discord.gg/xFejWpb) for more information.

## Discord
All participants to a Wolf Warrior tournament must be present in the [WolfTV Discord](https://discord.gg/xFejWpb) and assign themselves the Wolf Warrior role. **Failure to join the WolfTV Discord will result in an automatic diqualification.**

## Language
In order to facilitate communication between players, tournament admins and mods, we request that all people who take part in the Wolf Warrior environment to favor English over other languages. (Although don't worry if your English is on the poor side, as long as we can all understand you)

## Registration
Registration for a specific Wolf Warrior event is done using the corresponding event link. The exact procedure may differ depending on the website used, so make sure to follow the instructions which come up on screen.

Registration deadlines may differ from event to event.

Participants under the age of 18 must submit a consent letter from their parent or legal guardian to the TOs (@The TO Pack in the Discord) and cannot take part in tournaments for games rated PEGI 18. Children under 12 are not allowed to take part in tournaments where cash prizes are involved.

An active subscription to the game platform's online service (e.g. PlayStation Plus, Xbox Game Pass Core, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate) may be required to take part in a given tournament.

## Check-in
You will be required to check-in before the event starts. The check-in period begins 30 minutes before the event starts and ends on the planned start time and will be done through the specific event page (The one where you registered) **No admin-side check-in will be done before, during or after the check-in period** outside of very specific cases, so don't forget to check-in!

## Starting the tournament
Once you are checked-in, you will have to wait for the tournament to start. A tournament admin will ping the specific game role when the tournament is ready to start. As such, **any games played before the admin greenlight will not count towards tournament results**.

## Getting into a game
Once the tournament starts, the tournament admin will call out which rounds of the tournament can be played. **Please wait until your current tournament round has been called out before playing the associated match**.

In order to communicate with your opponent, you can use any of the numbered arena channels. We heavily encourage the use of said channels in order to exchange Online IDs and player interaction over other systems, including the chatboxes which may be provided on the event page.

Sometimes, tournament admins may decide a match should be streamed live. In this case, players involved in the match will be informed at the same time the tournament round gets called out, and communication will happen using the #stream-arena channel. Please note **the #stream-arena channel cannot be used for non-streamed matches**.

## Sportsmanship and lag
We want to remind everyone to keep civil in the discussions and follow some basic principles of sportsmanship. In case of disagreement, please warn a mod or tournament admin, we will then take appropriate action depending on the situation.

Given the context of online tournaments, technical issues such as extreme lag may happen. In case this happens, please ask a mod or tournament admin for help so we can try and debug the situation and make the appropriate decision once we have all the data available.

Please note that players playing on Wi-Fi will be disqualified.

## Region-locked tournament
The Wolf Warrior events are currently region-locked to Europe and Maghreb. **Entering from another region will result in you getting banned from the event.**

### Region guide

- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º **Europe:** European Union, United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Monaco, Andorra, Vatican City, San Marino, Montenegro, Liechtenstein, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Albania, Moldova, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia-West (Northwestern, Central, North Caucasian, Southern, Crimea, Volga)
- ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦ **Maghreb:** Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Western Sahara, Canary Islands, Madere Islands, Lybia, Mauritania

## Cash prizes
An event may reward good placing players with a cash prize in some instances. Should this happen, the total cash prize for the event will be communicated ahead of the tournament, and will be split between the Top 3 placements as follows:

- 1st: 1/2 of the cash prize (50 %)
- 2nd: 1/3 of the cash prize (~33 %)
- 3rd: 1/6 of the cash prize (~17 %)

Some additional requirements may need to be met in order to claim their prize, such as having an account on a given website. **Failure to meet those requirements 10 days after the event has ended will result in you no longer being eligible to get any prizes.** In which case the cash prize will be redistributed between all players who met the requirements. Should all 3 winners of the prize pot not meet the requirements, the pot will be redistributed either as part of the pot for a future event or as sponsorship money for partnered events.
